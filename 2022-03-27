/************************************************************************
Three people were bigger than their meals, and each said two words.
A said: B eats more than I do, and C eats as much as I do.
B said: a eats more than I, and a eats more than C.
C said: I eat more than B, and B eats more than a.
In fact, people who eat less say more right. Please program to output 
the order of 3 people according to the size of the meal.
