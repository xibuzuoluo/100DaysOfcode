/****************************************
The tree outside the school gate.
There is a row of trees on the road with a distance of L at the gate of a school. 
The distance between two adjacent trees is 1 meter. We can view the road as a number line, 
where one end of the road is at 0 and the other end is at L; Every integer point on the number line, 0,1,2... L, both have a tree.

There are areas of the road that will be used for the subway, and these areas are 
represented by their starting and ending points on the number line. Given that the coordinates 
of the starting and ending points of any region are integers, there may be some overlap between the regions. 
Now you want to remove the trees in these regions, including the two trees at the end of the region. 
Your task is to calculate how many trees will remain on the road after you remove them all.
