/*******************************************************************************
Queuing game.
Arrange the same number of  boys and girls in a queue, and each child is 
given a number according to its position in the queue.
The boy standing in front of him can leave the queue hand in hand with the 
adjacent girl behind him. The remaining children stand together again, 
and then press the adjacent little boys and girls to leave the queue hand in hand. 
The game goes back and forth. It just ensures that two children can leave the queue 
hand in hand every time, and the last two children to leave are the two children 
with the smallest number and the largest number.
